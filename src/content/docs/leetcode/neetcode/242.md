## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

## Solution

### Solution 1
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) == 0 or len(t) == 0:
            return False
        
        # create two initial hash map for s and t
        hm_s = {}
        hm_t = {}

        # iterate s and t
        for c in s:
            hm_s[c] += hm_s.get(c, 0) + 1
        for c in t:
            hm_t[c] += hm_t.get(c, 0) + 1
        
        # check if same
        return hm_s == hm_t
```
Explanation:
- Create two hash maps to store the frequency of each character in s and t.
- Iterate over s and t and add the frequency of each character to the hash map.
- Compare the two hash maps to see if they are the same.


### Solution 2
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

Explanation:
- Sort the strings and compare them.

## Complexity

n: len(s) <br>
m: len(t)

### Time Complexity

O(n + m)

- `sorted(s)` will sort the string. This is O(n).
- `sorted(t)` will sort the string. This is O(m).

### Space Complexity

O(1)

- `sorted(s)` the maximum space is 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).
- `sorted(t)` the maximum space is 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).
- 26 + 26 = 52, which is a constant. So the space complexity is O(1).
