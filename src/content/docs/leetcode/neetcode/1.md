## Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6, we return [1, 2].
```

Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 6, we return [0, 1].
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        if len(nums) == 2:
            return [0, 1]

        # create a initial hash map
        hm = {}

        # iterate nums
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            remaining = target - num
            # check if remaining value exist in hash map
            if remaining in hm: 
                return [hm[remaining], index]
            # add num and index to hash map
            else:
                hm[num] = index
```

Explanation:
- Use a hash map (value -> index) to store the indices of the numbers.
- Iterate over the list and calculate the remaining value.
- Check if the remaining value exists in the hash map.
- If it does, return the indices.
- If it doesn't, add the current number and its index to the hash map.

## Complexity

n: len(nums)

### Time Complexity

O(n)

- Iterate over the list once.

### Space Complexity

O(n)

- Use a hash map to store the indices of the numbers.
